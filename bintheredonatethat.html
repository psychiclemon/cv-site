                        <h2>about</h2> 
                        <p>Bin There, Donate That is a grassroots recycling initiative, based in East Finchley, aiming to reduce what goes to landfill through offering more reuse/recycling options beyond the scope of council bins. By establishing contacts in local shops, we have set up drop-off points accessible to the whole community. This stops many items from going to landfill, from crisp packets to art supplies, old toothbrushes to bras, ultimately reducing carbon emissions. </p>
                        <p>Being three years old, Bin There Donate That has experience liaising with local businesses, reaching out to the community and establishing links with local schools. We already have a dedicated core team of volunteers. We recently began liaising with organisations like Community Focus, where we led a workshop for children with disabilities about making art from recycled materials, subsequently educating on emissions reductions while simultaneously reducing through reuse. </p>

                        <h2>improving recycling accessibility</h2> 
                        <p>This project is crucial to the improvement of recycling accessibility in East Finchley, and potentially the whole of Barnet. By setting up Terracycle boxes we can allow all local residents to recycle more during their usual high street activities. Instead of needing a car and the time necessary to frequent a larger supermarket, any members of the community that visit the high street can use the drop of points, and support local independent shops. Bin There, Donate That is made up and developed by people in the community who can see the gaps in what is provided by the council, and what else we can do to decrease waste to landfill. </p>
                        <p>Bin There, Donate That goes beyond conventional recycling options. By adopting an holistic approach for a wide range of items, which incorporates community needs and upcycling ideas, we demonstrate a creative and innovative mindset. For example, Grange Big Local has recently asked us to collect trousers for them to make draft exactors. Furthermore, we actively engage with the community, businesses, and schools. By liaising with local businesses, leading workshops for children with disabilities, and educating on emissions reductions, Bin There Donate That not only collects items for effective recycling but also promotes awareness and education on sustainable practices, making the initiative more impactful.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, Bin There, Donate That continues to highlight the potential for decreasing the amount of rubbish going to landfill, and empowering the community by seeing the cumulative effect of the high street, and everyone who uses it, working together. </p>

                    <p>
                        Bin There, Donate That is all about empowering the local residents by increasing accessibility to recycling. Integral to the operations of our organisation is communicating and liaising with local shopowners, residents with ideas, volunteers who want to help, and the local newspaper the Archer, to let everyone know how we are getting on. Beyond this we also connect with other local groups, for example collecting material for Grange Big Local, or delivering workshops to organisations like Community Focus, during their half term sustainability camp for children with disabilities. In this workshop we delivered information to the children about recycling in Barnet, as well as getting creative with recycled materials we had collected for them.

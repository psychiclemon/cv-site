                    <h2>profile</h2> 
                    <p>Enthusiastic about applying problem solving and creativity to real societal problems. Having achieved strong academic results, I find studying a Masters in Electrical Engineering combines my natural mathematics capabilities with innovation and idea generation. I'm a keen environmentalist. Recently I have applied my enthusiasm for recycling and sustainability in a not-for-profit grass roots initiative, developing my leadership and administration skills. My many roles in cafes, libraries, student societies and volunteering demonstrate my energy, curiosity, and interpersonal skills.</p>
